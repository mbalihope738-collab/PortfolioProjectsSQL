In this project, I analysed COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data using SQL Server.
The goal of this project was to explore trends, calculate key metrics, and understand the relationship between infection rates, death rates, and vaccinations.
I worked with large datasets and performed data cleaning, calculations, and analysis directly in SQL Server Management Studio.

In this project I applied:
SELECT, FROM, WHERE
ORDER BY (ASC & DESC)
GROUP BY
SUM, MAX
Percentage calculations using (value) * 100
CAST for data type conversion
Handling NULL values
CTE (Common Table Expressions)
CREATE TABLE
INSERT INTO
DROP TABLE
CREATE VIEW
I also joined datasets to compare deaths and vaccination data by location and date.

Key Analysis Performed :
Calculated death percentage by country
Compared total cases vs total deaths
Analysed vaccination progress over time
Calculated vaccination percentage relative to population
Identified countries with highest infection rates

What I Learned :
Understand how to structure and clean large datasets
Improve my SQL query writing skills
Debug column and join issues
Work with multiple tables in one database
Think analytically about real-world data
